----------------------------------------------TROUBLE SHOOT---------------------------------------------------------
1. If there are any trouble building from an imported project from github or zip, FIRST observation should be into gradle.
It has been 1 year and a half (as of today) since this course was created, android studio & gradle will definitely be outdated.
Ensure that the gradle version in build.gradle and gradle-wrapper.properties are up-to-date. 

2. Android Studio is already convenient to use for launching our code to our devices. However, if we decide to somehow change to command line prompts,
you would need to go to the root of the project then you need to run:

    chmod +x gradlew - This command only needs to be run once and is used to give gradlew the correct execute permissions.
    ./gradlew assembleDebug - This command will compile the code.
    adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/app-debug-unaligned.apk - This command will install the APK. With the -r flag it will overwrite any prior installed versions. Note if you have more than one device, you will need to use the -s flag right after adb to specify the serial number of the intended device.
    adb shell am start -n com.example.android.sunshine.app/com.example.android.sunshine.app.MainActivity - This command will actually run the app.
